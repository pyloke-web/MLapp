##ðŸ‘‹ Data Analytics Tool (AutoML | Regression)
This is a very basic analytics web app project made using Streamlit. Through this app you will be able to do simple data manipulation, analysis, visualisation and automatic machine learning using regression models. Here are some basic information ðŸ‘‰")
##### Data Preprocessing
First, upload your dataset (CSV file) and explore your data through the data viewer. If you have missing values, you can choose to keep, drop, fill or impute missing values. If you only want to examine a few column, deselect the columns you'd like to remove from this analysis. Once you're satisfied with the data, just head onto either tab - your data will be stored throughout the session.
##### Data Profile Report
This tool uses pandas_profiling package to return a data profile report based on your dataset.
##### Data Visualisation
This tool allows you to do basic visualisations by defining your target and entity variable.
##### Machine Learning Models (Regression)
This tool uses pycaret to automatically run a series of regression model based on your dataset and return their performance.
